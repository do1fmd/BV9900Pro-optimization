# Bugs probably fixed, but need more testing
I am personally not affected by the bugs below, but some other users already tried to fix them. More testing is needed here.
## Wireless charging not working
Some people reported wireless charging is not working randomly.
Some phones seem to have a cool-down period of up to two days after a full charge.
Best workaround for now: Do not charge the battery to not more than 90 %.
[Advanced Charging Controller (ACCA)](https://f-droid.org/packages/mattecarra.accapp/) will help you here.\

# Bugs to fix
There are still some Bugs, which have to be investigated and fixed.

1. Some high frequency nosie coming from the main speaker when touch, key tones or camera shutter sounds are played.
