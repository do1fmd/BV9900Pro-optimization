# Bugs to fix
There are still some Bugs, which have to be investigated and fixed.

1. Some high frequency nosie coming from the main speaker when touch, key tones or camera shutter sounds are played.
2. Sometimes the microphone in calls is not working well. It does volume down randomly. -> Maybe a problem with noise cancellation?
